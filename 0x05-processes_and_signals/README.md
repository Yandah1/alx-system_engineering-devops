Readme:0x05 Processes and Signals in DevOps Shell Scripting


Introduction to Processes
In the context of DevOps and shell scripting, a process refers to an executing instance of a program within an operating system. Understanding processes is crucial for managing and automating tasks in a system environment. When writing shell scripts, you often interact with various processes to perform actions such as launching programs, monitoring their execution, and controlling their behavior.

Working with Signals
Signals are software interrupts that notify processes about specific events or conditions. They provide a mechanism for process-to-process communication and allow you to control the behavior of running programs. Signals are an essential part of managing processes, especially in scenarios where you need to start, stop, or restart services gracefully.
